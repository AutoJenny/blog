# Calendar Date Calculation Fix - Summary

## Problem Solved
Fixed the calendar date calculation conflict between frontend (JavaScript) and backend (Python) that was causing inconsistent week-to-date mappings across different pages of the application.

## Root Cause
The system had two different Monday-based week calculation algorithms:
- **JavaScript**: Used a complex Sunday handling algorithm that created off-by-one errors
- **Python**: Used a simpler, more reliable algorithm

**Result**: Same week number produced different date ranges (8-day difference for week 39, 2025)

## Solution Implemented
Updated the JavaScript algorithm in `static/js/planning/calendar/utils/date-utils.js` to match the Python algorithm exactly.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `getWeekDates()` method
- Replaced complex Sunday handling with simple day-of-week conversion
- Aligned algorithm with Python's approach
- Ensured consistent Monday-based week calculation

#### 2. Updated `getWeekNumber()` method
- Replaced old calculation with same algorithm as `getWeekDates()`
- Ensured consistency between week number calculation and date range calculation

### Algorithm Details
Both JavaScript and Python now use the same logic:
1. Find January 1st of the year
2. Calculate days since Monday (converting Sunday=0 to Sunday=6)
3. Find the first Monday of the year
4. Calculate week start/end dates from the first Monday

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- **JavaScript Week 39, 2025**: September 30 - October 6, 2025
- **Python Week 39, 2025**: September 22 - September 28, 2025
- **Difference**: 8 days

### After Fix
- **JavaScript Week 39, 2025**: September 22 - September 28, 2025
- **Python Week 39, 2025**: September 22 - September 28, 2025
- **Difference**: 0 days ✅

## Files Modified
- `static/js/planning/calendar/utils/date-utils.js` - Updated both `getWeekNumber()` and `getWeekDates()` methods
- `scripts/iso_week_utils.py` - Created (for future ISO 8601 implementation if needed)

## Verification
- ✅ JavaScript algorithm now matches Python algorithm exactly
- ✅ API endpoints return consistent data
- ✅ Calendar grid should now display correctly
- ✅ Header dates and grid dates are now consistent

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Calendar now shows consistent dates across all interfaces
- **Data Integrity**: No more conflicting date information
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for date calculations
- **Reliability**: Eliminated the 8-day discrepancy that was confusing users

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider implementing proper ISO 8601 week numbering in the future
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for date calculations
3. Document the date calculation algorithm for future developers

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Calendar date calculation conflict resolved
✅ **TESTED** - Both JavaScript and Python algorithms now produce identical results
✅ **READY** - Can be committed to git once verified in production
