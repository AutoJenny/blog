Create a new record or update an existing one in the database.\n2. Verify that the record has been saved by querying the database and checking for the presence of the record.\n3. Optionally, you can also verify that the record was saved correctly by comparing it to the expected value or values.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 for multiple records if necessary.\n\nHere's a more detailed example using Python and SQLite:\n\nFirst, create a new table in your SQLite database with some columns:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef setup():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT)''')\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n```\n\nNext, add some records to the table:\n\n```python\ndef add_record(name):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute("INSERT INTO test_table (name) VALUES (?)", (name,))\n    conn.commit()\n    conn.close()\n\nadd_record('Record 1')\nadd_record('Record 2')\n```\n\nThen, verify that the records were saved by querying the table:\n\n```python\ndef test_save():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    c.execute("SELECT * FROM test_table")\n    rows = c.fetchall()\n\n    print(rows)\n\n    conn.close()\n\ntest_save()\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[(1, 'Record 1'), (2, 'Record 2')]\n```\n\nYou can also modify the `add_record` function to add incorrect data and test for errors:\n\n```python\ndef add_record(name):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('test.db')\n    c = conn.cursor()\n\n    try:\n        c.execute("INSERT INTO test_table (name) VALUES (?)", (name,))\n        conn.commit()\n        conn.close()\n    except sqlite3.IntegrityError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\nNow, when you add a record with an existing name, it will raise an error and you can test for that:\n\n```python\nadd_record('Record 1')\nadd_record('Record 1')\ntest_save()\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n(IntegrityError) error code 19: duplicate key value found: 'Record 1'\n```	2025-08-04 08:08:22.996502	 Title: A Vibrant Montage of Scottish Story-telling Through the Ages\n\nThe montage image aims to illustrate the rich history and evolution of story-telling in Scotland. The layout consists of a collage of five distinct scenes, each representing a specific era or aspect of Scottish story-telling as described in the given section headings.\n\nScene 1: "Ancient Celtic Story-telling"\nThis scene portrays an open, misty moorland beneath an overcast sky.

Surrounding him are various symbols of Celtic mythology – a silver moon, stars, and interwoven patterns representing nature and the supernatural.\n\nScene 2: "Medieval Period: Recording Stories"\nA monk sits in a dimly lit stone cell at Iona Abbey, meticulously copying an ancient manuscript by the light of a single candle. In the background, a cloistered monastery and a lush landscape with a loch can be seen. This scene highlights the significance of religious stories and their role in preserving tales from the past.\n\nScene 3: "Scottish Literary Masters: Robertson, Barrie, Gaiman"\nThe third scene features a blend of modern and historic elements – a lively bookstore with wooden shelves filled with books by renowned Scottish authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson, J.M. Barrie, and Neil Gaiman. The warm, inviting atmosphere is complemented by the bustling energy of customers browsing for their favorite tales.\n\nScene 4: "Preserving Cultural Traditions through Story-telling"\nA traditional Scottish highland village in the background serves as the setting for this scene. An elder woman stands at the center, surrounded by young children gathered around her, as she tells an engaging story. Her words flow like a gentle river, and her voice captures their imaginations.\n\nScene 5: "Evolution of Scottish Story-telling: Modern Era"\nA contemporary setting is depicted in this final scene – a modern studio with state-of-the-art equipment where a podcast host records an episode of a popular storytelling podcast. The dynamic energy and excitement conveyed through the recording process symbolize how story-telling has adapted to modern mediums such as novels, podcasts, film and television productions.\n\nThe montage's background is a soft, muted blend of Scottish landscapes – rolling hills, lochs, castles, and forests – representing the rich tapestry that has shaped Scotland's literary heritage. Throughout the image, various elements from each scene weave together to form a cohesive story that highlights the enduring power of story-telling in shaping and preserving Scottish culture.	\N
