# Database Robustness Improvement Plan

## Current Implementation
- Hourly database backups with 14-day retention
- Schema verification and auto-initialization
- 5-minute health monitoring checks
- Basic database and application health validation

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Monitoring and Alerting
- **Email Notifications**
  - Set up SMTP configuration for alerts
  - Define alert severity levels
  - Configure rate limiting for alerts
  - Add team notification preferences
  - Include detailed error context in notifications

- **Enhanced Health Checks**
  - Monitor database connection pool health
  - Track query performance metrics
  - Monitor disk space usage
  - Check for long-running transactions
  - Validate database indexes
  - Monitor replication lag (when implemented)

### 2. High Availability
- **Database Replication**
  - Set up PostgreSQL streaming replication
  - Configure automatic failover
  - Implement read replicas for reporting queries
  - Monitor replication lag
  - Document failover procedures

- **Backup Enhancements**
  - Implement point-in-time recovery
  - Add backup encryption
  - Set up off-site backup storage
  - Automate backup verification
  - Regular restore testing

### 3. Recovery Automation
- **Automated Recovery Procedures**
  - Define recovery scenarios
  - Create automated recovery scripts
  - Implement transaction log shipping
  - Set up automated restore testing
  - Document manual intervention points

- **Failure Prevention**
  - Implement connection pooling
  - Add query timeout limits
  - Set up statement timeouts
  - Configure automatic vacuum
  - Monitor and manage bloat

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Query Optimization**
  - Regular EXPLAIN ANALYZE of common queries
  - Index usage analysis
  - Query plan monitoring
  - Automated slow query detection
  - Query optimization recommendations

- **Resource Management**
  - Connection pool tuning
  - Memory allocation optimization
  - Work memory configuration
  - Maintenance work memory settings
  - Autovacuum tuning

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority** (1-2 weeks)
   - Email notifications for critical errors
   - Enhanced backup verification
   - Basic query monitoring
   - Connection pooling

2. **Medium Priority** (2-4 weeks)
   - Database replication setup
   - Automated recovery scripts
   - Performance monitoring
   - Off-site backup storage

3. **Lower Priority** (4-8 weeks)
   - Advanced query optimization
   - Automated restore testing
   - Fine-tuned resource management
   - Extended monitoring metrics

## Notes
- All improvements should be documented in `/docs`
- Changes should be tested in staging first
- Consider cloud backup solutions
- Plan for disaster recovery scenarios
- Regular testing of recovery procedures
