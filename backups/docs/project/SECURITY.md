# Security Policy

## Authentication and Access Control

This project is designed to be a simple, open blog system without authentication requirements. This is an intentional design decision to:

1. Keep the system simple and maintainable
2. Avoid the complexity and security risks of managing user credentials
3. Make the blog content and management interfaces openly accessible

### Important Notes

- **NO Authentication**: The system does not implement any form of user authentication or login
- **NO Access Control**: All routes and endpoints are publicly accessible
- **NO User Management**: There is no concept of users or user roles in the system

### Security Considerations

While the system does not implement authentication, it still maintains other security best practices:

1. **Data Integrity**:
   - Database backups are automatically created
   - Database replication ensures data redundancy
   - Integrity checks are performed on database operations

2. **Input Validation**:
   - All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
   - SQL injection protection through SQLAlchemy
   - XSS protection through template escaping

3. **Configuration Security**:
   - Sensitive configuration values are stored in environment variables
   - API keys and secrets are never hardcoded
   - Debug mode is disabled in production

### Deployment Recommendations

If you need to restrict access to certain parts of the system, it is recommended to:

1. Use server-level access controls (e.g., nginx auth, IP restrictions)
2. Deploy behind a reverse proxy with access control
3. Use network-level security measures

### Future Considerations

If authentication becomes necessary in the future, it should be implemented:
1. As a separate, optional module
2. Without affecting the core functionality
3. With proper security review and testing
