2024-05-02: Fixed TypeError in /llm/templates New Template button (showNewTemplateModal) by adding null and classList check before accessing classList.contains on selectedFields.firstChild.

2024-05-02: Removed 'Source Field' and all test functionality from /llm/actions page, including UI, form fields, tabs, and related JavaScript logic. Actions now only define field name, prompt template, model, temperature, and max tokens.

2024-05-02: Fix New Action modal to populate LLM model and prompt template selects using availableModels and availablePrompts, matching builder tab.

2024-05-02: Unify modal and builder form field names/IDs for LLM Action creation, and update modal JS to match builder logic. Fixes 'Unknown error' on Action save.

2024-05-02: Improve action form submission logic to prevent false error alerts, disable submit button, log result, and reload only after success. Fixes misleading 'Unknown error' alert.

2024-05-02: Prevent error alert after successful action save by reloading and returning immediately. Fixes race condition in both builder and modal forms.

2024-05-02: Remove duplicate modal form event handlers before adding a new one, using a named handler. Prevents false error alerts after successful save.

- FIX: Standardized all /api/v1/llm/actions and /api/v1/llm/actions/<id> endpoints to return {status: 'success', action: ...} or {status: 'error', error: ...} for all GET, PUT, and DELETE requests. This resolves frontend error dialog issues due to inconsistent API responses.

- ENHANCEMENT: Added prompt_template_id to LLMAction model and API responses. The edit form for LLM Actions now pre-selects the correct prompt template when editing an action.

- FIX: Removed all debug alert and console messages from LLM Actions page scripts. Improved editAction logic to ensure dropdowns are reliably pre-loaded with the correct values when editing an action.

- FIX: Edit Action form now always pre-loads dropdowns with the correct values by awaiting data initialization before setting form values.

- Fix: LLM Actions Edit now pre-populates fields correctly (uses data.action.<field>).
- Fix: New Action modal now starts with blank/placeholder selects for model and prompt template, so nothing is pre-selected by default.

- Fix: Corrected TemplateSyntaxError in app/templates/blog/develop.html by adding missing closing brace to the Jinja expression for postId in the LLM action button scripts for 'idea_scope' and 'provisional_title'.

2024-07-09: Fix LLMAction prompt template field substitution. Prompt templates now support {{field}} for any PostDevelopment field (e.g., {{basic_idea}}), not just {input}. Backend fetches all fields for the post and substitutes them using Jinja2. This enables LLM actions to work as expected for all referenced fields in prompts.

2024-07-09: Add robust logging for Jinja2 template errors in LLMAction.process_template. Now logs the template string and fields dict to help debug template rendering issues.

2024-07-09: Add debug endpoint /api/v1/llm/actions/debug/list_templates to list all LLMAction prompt templates for troubleshooting template errors.

- Fix: Resolved TemplateSyntaxError in app/templates/llm/templates.html caused by Jinja2 parsing a JavaScript template literal (`{{ ${draggedField} }}`) in the template editor. Wrapped the line in `{% raw %}...{% endraw %}` to prevent Jinja2 from interpreting it.

- Fix: Drag&drop field insertion in app/templates/llm/templates.html now inserts {{field_name}} (no spaces, no hidden chars). Removed hidden characters that caused backend template errors.

- Add: Implemented /api/v1/posts/<post_id>/fields/<field> endpoint to allow saving individual PostDevelopment fields from the develop page. This fixes saving for global fields like Idea Scope.

- Refactor: Switched postId passing in develop.html to use a data attribute on the main container, and updated all JS to read postId from the DOM instead of inline Jinja2. This prevents template syntax errors and is more robust.

- Enhancement: Added LLM Action selector and Generate button to every field (except sections) on the develop page, and ensured the Generate button saves the field after generation. This makes LLM generation available for all fields and ensures saving works.

- Enhancement: Replaced the Section Order textarea in the Outlining Stage with a Grab Headings button, draggable list, and Save button. This allows users to visually reorder section headings and save the new order as JSON.

- Added DELETE endpoint /api/v1/section/<int:section_id> to allow deleting sections from the Authoring stage in the post development interface.

- UI/UX: Improved section accordions in the Authoring stage. Added chevron icon, highlight for open section, hover effect, and animated open/close for better usability.

- Enhancement: 'Ideas to include' and 'Facts to include' fields in each section are now persisted in the database and auto-saved in the UI, with values pre-populated from the backend.

- Added endpoint: PUT /api/v1/posts/<post_id>/sections/<section_id>/fields/<field> to allow saving individual section fields (including new ones) from the UI.

- Refactor: Deprecated app/services/llm.py and consolidated all LLM service logic into app/llm/services.py. Updated all imports and usages. See docs/llm_service_refactor.md for details.

- Enhancement: The Idea Scope LLM Generate button now auto-saves the generated content to the backend, ensuring the UI and db are updated immediately after generation.

2025-05-05 Fix: Removed unwanted special character from draggable field template string in llm/templates.html. Field insertion now correctly uses {{field_name}} syntax without extra characters.

2025-05-05 Added 'ideas_to_include', 'facts_to_include', and 'section_heading' to the Authoring Stage in WORKFLOW_FIELDS (app/blog/fields.py) so they are available for prompt templates and saving in the UI.

2025-05-05 Enhancement: Added LLM action selectors beside each Generate button for section fields in the Authoring stage in develop.html, and updated JS to use the selected action for section content generation.

2025-05-05 Fix: Section LLM action selectors now populate reliably—JS populates all selectors after DOM is ready, before attaching click handlers, ensuring menus are filled as soon as the page loads.

- Enhancement: Automatic database backup now runs after every commit (insert, update, or delete), with old backups rotated to prevent bloat. This uses a SQLAlchemy event listener and the existing backup script.

- UI: Section Generate buttons now show 'Generating...' and are disabled while the request is in progress, preventing double-clicks and giving clear feedback to the user.

- Enhancement: Added drag-and-drop reordering for prompt templates with visible gap indicator. Order is now persisted in the database and respected in all selection menus. Added /api/v1/llm/prompts/order endpoint to update order.

- Fix: LLM prompt templates and selection menus now always reflect the persisted order by ordering on the 'order' field in all UI routes.

- Refactored LLM Actions page (`/llm/actions`) to use accordion and drag-and-drop UI, matching the prompt templates page.
    - Each action is now a draggable accordion item with only the title and Edit button visible by default.
    - Clicking the header expands to show action details.
    - Drag-and-drop reordering is enabled and persists order via the API.

- Add: Implemented /api/v1/llm/actions/order endpoint and added 'order' field to LLMAction model to support drag-and-drop ordering of actions in the admin UI.
- Fix: Migration now sets all NULL values in llm_prompt.order to 0 before making the column NOT NULL, preventing migration errors.

- Fix: The LLM Actions page modal is now a true overlay, never rendered inline. The modal is hidden by default and only shown when triggered. All legacy builder form and tab logic is removed. The modal is now the only way to add/edit actions, and overlays the page properly.

- Change: The New Action form is now hidden by default and only appears above the list when the New Action button is clicked. Editing an action also shows the form. A Cancel button hides the form. All modal and always-visible logic is removed.

- Enhancement: The /api/v1/llm/actions/<id>/execute endpoint now merges section_fields from the request into the template context, allowing LLM prompt templates to use section-specific variables like {{section_heading}}, {{ideas_to_include}}, etc. This enables section actions (e.g., Write Section first draft) to access all relevant per-section data.

- Debug patch: Added a visible log area and debug output to the Generate All Sections button handler in app/templates/blog/develop.html. This includes:
  - A log area above the button to show progress and errors.
  - Console log and alert at the start of the click handler to confirm it is firing.
  - Error handling for fetch failures and network errors.
  - Improved feedback for each section's generation attempt.

- Made Content, Images, and Meta areas within each Section of the Authoring Stage in develop.html visually distinct and collapsible:
  - Added unique background colors and borders for each inner panel.
  - Added chevrons to each inner-accordion-header.
  - Implemented JavaScript to toggle inner-accordion-content and ensure only one is open at a time per section.

- Refactor: Broke up the Authoring Stage (Sections) in develop.html into three separate stages: 'Sections - Authoring', 'Sections - Images', and 'Sections - Meta', each with its own accordion panel and relevant fields.

[YYYY-MM-DD] Added CRUD API endpoints for ImageStyle (list, get, create, update, delete) in app/api/routes.py under /api/v1/images/styles and /api/v1/images/styles/<id>.

[YYYY-MM-DD] UI: Image style dropdown in images_prompts.html is now dynamic, fetching from the API, and supports adding new styles via modal dialog. Edit/delete coming next.

[YYYY-MM-DD] UI: Edit and delete functionality for image styles is now available in the image prompt creation UI (images_prompts.html). Users can edit or delete styles directly from the dropdown.

[YYYY-MM-DD] Enhancement: ImageStyle.description column changed from String(255) to Text (unlimited length). Migration applied.

[YYYY-MM-DD] Add: ImageFormat model and CRUD API endpoints for format management (description limited to 255 chars), mirroring ImageStyle functionality.

- Debug: Added robust debug logging to the /api/v1/llm/actions/<id>/execute endpoint in app/api/llm.py. This logs all incoming data, constructed fields, and full stack traces for any errors, to surface the root cause of persistent 500 errors during LLM Action execution.

- Enhancement: Added a full CRUD Format menu to the LLM Images Prompts page, mirroring the Styles menu. Users can now add, edit, and delete image formats via a dropdown, modal, and API integration with /api/v1/images/formats.

2025-05-07: Added ImageSetting UI to /llm/images/prompts. New menu above Style/Format allows selecting, creating, editing, and deleting ImageSettings (name, style, format). Selecting an ImageSetting auto-selects the corresponding Style and Format. Includes modal for add/edit and full JS integration.

[UI] Move ImageSetting menu above Style/Format in images_prompts.html so it appears as the first field in the form.

2025-05-07: Add /api/v1/comfyui/status and /api/v1/comfyui/start endpoints to allow the UI to check if ComfyUI is running and start it if needed (for hybrid integration).

2025-05-07: Add /api/v1/images/generate endpoint for prompt-to-image generation using ComfyUI and SD1.5, with output image copying for UI display in the hybrid UI.

2025-05-07: Major navigation and tab refactor. Added 'Images' as a top-level menu item in the main header. Refactored all /llm/images/* pages to use consistent, modern-styled tabs for section and sub-section navigation (Image Configs, Image Prompts, Image Previews; Simple/Advanced under Configs).

2024-07-09: Updated the ComfyUI workflow in app/api/routes.py generate_image endpoint to use a separate CLIPLoader node for SD 3.5 Large, resolving the issue where the CLIP was not recognized from the checkpoint.

- Excluded sd3.5_large_turbo_all_files/ (comfyUI files) in .gitignore to prevent git commit hangs due to large files.

2024-07-09: Comprehensive update to docs/sd_integration.md with full Stable Diffusion + ComfyUI implementation details, including architecture, setup, endpoints, UI, workflow, file handling, extensibility, and troubleshooting.

2024-07-09: Added batch image generation UI to blog post workflow (develop.html) and updated implementation plan to reflect progress on LLM image generation system.

2025-05-XX
- Enhancement: The /api/v1/images/generate endpoint now returns the full prompt, settings, and workflow JSON for SD requests. The /llm/images/prompts UI displays this info below each test result with a Show Debug toggle, making it easy to inspect exactly what is sent to ComfyUI for each image generation.

2025-05-XX
- Fix: Removed all JavaScript code referencing styleSelect and formatSelect from app/templates/llm/images_prompts.html, resolving JS errors and restoring Test button functionality after UI refactor.

2025-05-XX
- Fix: Updated backend image polling logic to wait for file size to be stable for 3 seconds before serving, preventing partial/black images when ComfyUI is still writing the file.

2025-05-XX
- Enhancement: The Image Setting dropdown in /llm/images/prompts now supports saving, editing, and deleting full ComfyUI settings (width, height, steps, guidance scale, etc.) with a Name field and Save button. Selecting a setting populates all fields. All changes are synced with the backend.

2025-05-18: Fixed /db/ page by commenting out buttons for non-existent endpoints (db.backup, db.vacuum, db.check_integrity) in app/templates/db/index.html. The Database Management page now loads without error.

2025-05-18: UI fix for /db/: admin cards now always stack vertically (removed md:grid-cols-2 from grid layout in app/templates/db/index.html).

2025-05-18: Started deprecating SQLAlchemy ORM in favor of direct SQL using psycopg2. Added psycopg2 to requirements.txt. Beginning codebase refactor to remove all SQLAlchemy usage.

2025-05-18: All /db/ admin routes now use direct SQL via psycopg2. Removed all SQLAlchemy usage from app/database/routes.py. This is the first major step in the ORM deprecation.

2025-05-18: Blog index route (/) now uses direct SQL via psycopg2. Removed SQLAlchemy usage from the index view in app/blog/routes.py. Migration to direct SQL continues.

2025-05-18: Removed SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy from requirements.txt. The project now uses only direct SQL for all database operations. ORM fully deprecated.

2025-05-18: Added scripts/populate_sample_data.py and used it to insert sample data into category, tag, post, post_development, and post_section tables using direct SQL.

[2025-05-18] Enhanced import_from_old_blog.py to:
- Use blog/__blog_old/posts/ and blog/__blog_old/_data/image_library.json as sources.
- Skip importing posts/images that already exist in the database.
- Copy image files to app/static/images/posts/.
- Print a summary of imported and skipped items.

- Restored /tables route in blog/app/database/routes.py to previous working version (flat list, no grouping) after grouped version caused all tables to vanish from DB Content page.

- Reintroduced grouping in /tables route (blog/app/database/routes.py), but now omits empty groups and falls back to a flat list if no groups have tables. This prevents the DB Content page from being empty if grouping fails.

- /tables route now always returns both a flat 'tables' list and a 'groups' list (if grouping is possible), ensuring compatibility with the frontend and preventing empty DB Content display.

- DB Content UI now displays tables grouped by theme if available, with a fallback to a flat list. Updated blog/app/templates/db/index.html JavaScript to support this.

- /tables route now returns groups ordered alphabetically by group name (A-Z), so 'Blog/Post Related' comes first in the UI.

2025-05-20: Unified styling with blogforge
- Replaced app/static/css/src/main.css with blogforge's globals.css structure and variables.
- Removed all content from blog.css, style.css, and admin.css to disable legacy styles.
- Updated tailwind.config.js to add custom color tokens for border, background, etc. to support new utilities.
- Rebuilt Tailwind CSS output.
- Site now uses a modern, utility-first, variable-driven design matching blogforge.

2025-05-20: Workflow table migration
- Dropped old workflow_status table (multi-column, JSON-style, deprecated)
- Added new workflow table with columns:
    - id (PK)
    - post_id (FK to post.id, unique)
    - stage (ENUM: idea, research, structure, content, meta_information, images, preflight, publishing, syndication)
    - status (ENUM: draft, published, review, deleted)
    - created (timestamp, default now)
    - updated (timestamp, auto-updated)
- Updated create_tables.sql and docs/database/schema.md
- All future workflow tracking and API endpoints should use the new workflow table

2025-05-21: Normalized workflow stages and sub-stages
- Removed legacy stages from workflow_stage_entity, keeping only: planning, authoring, publishing
- Seeded workflow_sub_stage_entity with ordered sub-stages for each main stage:
  - planning: idea, research, structure
  - authoring: content, meta_info, images
  - publishing: preflight, launch, syndication
- Ensured all stages and sub-stages are ordered and normalized for future workflow logic

2024-05-21
- Blog index and header redesigned for a true dark theme.
- Unified header, navigation, and cards for a premium, cohesive look.
- All sections now use dark backgrounds, accent borders, and light text.
- Blog index moved from /blog/ to root URL (/).
- Fully redesigned the main page with a modern, stylish, and intuitive UI (see app/templates/blog/index.html).
- Navigation in base.html updated to use root for blog listing.
- Removed old blog.index endpoint and root_link.html template.
- Updated /docs/frontend/templates.md to reflect new structure and design.
- All references to the blog index now point to the root URL.

2024-05-21
- Redesigned workflow process indicator for dark theme: shallow, touchscreen-friendly, with three stage backgrounds and nine substages.
- Updated planning/index.html to use new indicator macro for process navigation.

2024-06-13: Created a comprehensive hybrid LLM framework refactor/extension implementation plan in docs/temp/llm_framework_hybrid_refactor.md. The plan documents rationale, step-by-step checklists, and onboarding notes for new developers, covering data model enhancements, service refactor, RESTful API design, UI/UX modernization, testing, documentation, and migration. This will guide the sustainable redevelopment of LLM operations in line with project conventions.

2025-05-22: Scaffolded LLM Actions, Logs, and Settings admin pages with modern UI, placeholder tables, modals, and forms. All LLM admin sub-pages are now scaffolded.

2025-05-22: UI: /llm/actions - removed repeated Actions heading, moved New Action button to top right, widened list container to max-w-5xl.

2024-06-13: Removed all specimen, sample, and hardcoded LLM action data from UI, templates, and routes. All LLM actions, prompts, and logs are now DB-driven only. Updated documentation to reflect this policy.

2024-05-22: Added /docs/project/flask_app_structure.md documenting the working Flask app structure, config, environment, and troubleshooting lessons to prevent future template/config issues.

[2025-05-22] Refactor: Updated LLMAction.to_dict() to include input_field, output_field, and full prompt part details. Refactored LLMService.execute_action to use modular prompt parts and input/output fields for robust, flexible action execution.

[2025-05-22] Add: CRUD API endpoints for LLMPromptPart and LLMActionPromptPart, including endpoints to manage prompt parts for a given action (add, reorder, remove, list).

[2025-05-22] Fix: LLMAction model and serialization now include 'field_name' for action name display in list and details UI. DB, model, and UI are now aligned.

[2025-05-22] Add: Script scripts/llm_workflow_fields_introspect.py outputs workflow substages and valid fields by introspecting the DB and cross-checking with WORKFLOW_FIELDS. Warns about mismatches for robust admin/UX use.

2025-05-23: Fixed critical DB privilege issue for llm_provider_id_seq (see docs/llm/llm_framework_hybrid_refactor.md). Granted superuser to postgres to prevent future permission errors. Successfully tested /api/v1/llm/providers CRUD endpoint. Updated implementation plan doc with progress.

2025-05-23: LLM Action modal now uses provider/model dropdowns, filtered by provider, and is fully registry-driven. Updated implementation plan doc with this progress.

2025-05-23: Added 'role' field (ENUM) to llm_prompt_part for message-based prompts. Updated implementation plan doc with this progress.

2025-05-23: Scaffolded Action Details modal for prompt part management (CRUD, reordering, test action) in LLM Actions UI. Updated implementation plan doc with this progress.

2025-05-23: Successfully performed a lossless restore of post and action data from backup, including all fields. llm_prompt_part was empty in the backup. Updated modular prompt refactor plan doc with details.

2025-05-25
- Fixed workflow action save bug: created post_substage_action table in PostgreSQL (not SQLite!)
- Removed all SQLite code and files; project is now PostgreSQL-only as per docs
- Updated docs/database/schema.md to document post_substage_action table
- Ensured all schema changes are non-destructive and follow backup-first policy
- LLM Action wizard Step 2 now loads Provider and Model dropdowns dynamically from the database, with robust loading and error handling. Improves UX and ensures DB-driven selection.

[2024-06-13] Fixed AttributeError for httpx.TimeoutError (now TimeoutException) in LLMService. Also fixed bug where Ollama API URL was not set in /api/v1/llm/test endpoint, causing ValueError. Verified fix with curl: /api/v1/llm/test now returns a valid LLM response.
