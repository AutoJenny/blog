### Common Issues

**"No sections found for this post"**
- Ensure the blog post has published sections

**"Generate all sections" button is disabled**
- Select a blog post first
- Ensure the post has sections available

**Generation fails or stops**
- Check that Ollama is running on your system
- Verify database connection
- Try refreshing the page and starting again

**Generated content seems poor quality**
- The AI uses the section content as input
- Ensure blog sections have sufficient content
- Check that section titles are descriptive

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs**: Look at the browser console for error messages
2. **Verify services**: Ensure Ollama and database are running
3. **Try again**: Most issues resolve with a page refresh
4. **Contact support**: Refer to technical documentation for advanced issues

## Best Practices

### For Better Results
- **Choose posts with rich content**: More detailed sections produce better posts
- **Use descriptive section titles**: These help the AI understand context
- **Review generated content**: Always check posts before using them
- **Process in batches**: Don't try to generate too many posts at once

### Content Guidelines
- **Keep sections focused**: Single-topic sections work best
- **Use clear titles**: Descriptive section titles improve AI understanding
- **Include context**: Background information helps generate relevant posts
- **Avoid very short sections**: At least 2-3 sentences work best
