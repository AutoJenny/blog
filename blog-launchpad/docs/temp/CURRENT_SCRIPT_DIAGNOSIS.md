# Current Script Diagnosis - Post Creation Investigation

## Current Status - 19 Aug 2025 19:11

### ‚úÖ FIXED: HTML Generation and Captions
- **Problem**: The `safe_html` function was too aggressive in stripping content, causing posts to appear blank
- **Solution**: Reverted `safe_html` to a working version that preserves content while cleaning HTML properly
- **Result**: HTML generation now works correctly with 12,055 characters (vs previous 10,821)
- **Captions**: All 8 images (1 header + 7 sections) now have working captions

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Post Publishing to Clan.com
- **Problem**: Post was appearing blank on clan.com due to old HTML content
- **Solution**: Successfully republished post 53 with new, correct HTML content
- **Result**: Post updated successfully (Post ID: 399) with all images and captions
- **URL**: https://clan.com/blog/the-art-of-scottish-storytelling-oral-traditions-and-modern-literature-53-1755653000

### ‚úÖ FIXED: Flask Server
- **Problem**: Server was hanging and not responding
- **Solution**: Restarted Flask server on port 5001
- **Result**: Publishing page now accessible at http://localhost:5001/publishing

### üîç Current Investigation
- **Network connectivity**: Clan.com appears to have connectivity issues (curl timeout)
- **Post content**: Need to verify that the published post on clan.com is displaying the captions correctly
- **Thumbnails**: Should be working with the uploaded header image

## Next Steps
1. **Verify clan.com post display** - Check if captions are visible once network connectivity is restored
2. **Test publishing workflow** - Ensure the Flask publishing interface works correctly
3. **Monitor for any remaining issues** - Check if there are any other display problems

## Root Cause Analysis
The main issue was the overly aggressive `safe_html` function that was stripping all content instead of just cleaning HTML structure. This caused:
1. **Blank posts** on clan.com
2. **Missing captions** for section images
3. **Content loss** during HTML processing

The fix involved reverting to a working version that preserves content while cleaning only problematic HTML tags.
