        <div class="section-text">
            
                During the medieval period in Scotland, stories began to be recorded for the first time.

These lengthy narratives featured heroes embarking on quests and overcoming adversity, inspiring a sense of pride and unity among their respective communities. Overall, the act of recording stories marked an essential milestone in Scotland's rich literary history.
