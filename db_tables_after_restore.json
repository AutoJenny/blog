Use fine, inked linework for figures and landscape elements, layered with visible, expressive watercolor brushstrokes. Emphasize the brush texture — each stroke should feel hand-painted, with pigment visibly thinning out or fraying toward the edges. The color should pool, bleed, and fade naturally, leaving irregular white margins and areas where the paint appears to have dried unevenly on textured paper. Maintain a light, warm, naturalistic color palette — earthy reds, mossy greens, ochres, and greys — and leave ample white space around the borders, as if the image were painted into a travel journal. The scene should appear partially unfinished at the margins, evoking the spontaneity of an observational field study.",

Use fine, inked linework for figures and landscape elements, layered with visible, expressive watercolor brushstrokes. Emphasize the brush texture — each stroke should feel hand-painted, with pigment visibly thinning out or fraying toward the edges. The color should pool, bleed, and fade naturally, leaving irregular white margins and areas where the paint appears to have dried unevenly on textured paper. Maintain a light, warm, naturalistic color palette — earthy reds, mossy greens, ochres, and greys — and leave ample white space around the borders, as if the image were painted into a travel journal. The scene should appear partially unfinished at the margins, evoking the spontaneity of an observational field study.",
