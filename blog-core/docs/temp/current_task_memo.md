## Task: Update Frontend LLM Action Outputs Dropdown

**Context:** We've been working on updating the content quality stages from the old four-field system (first_draft, generation, optimization, uk_british) to a simplified two-field system (draft, polished).

**Current Status:** 
- ✅ Backend migration completed (draft/polished fields)
- ✅ Preview system updated to use new fields
- ✅ Backend endpoint created to return all text fields from post_section
- ✅ Workflow content page fixed to use new field names
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Update frontend LLM action Outputs dropdown to use new endpoint
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Update documentation to prevent future confusion
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Fix sections loading issue in workflow content page

**Completed Work:**
- ✅ Fixed backend endpoint URL: `/api/workflow/post_section_fields` (was trying wrong URL)
- ✅ Updated `app/static/modules/llm_panel/js/field_selector.js` to use new endpoint
- ✅ Modified `initializeSingleFieldSelector()` to fetch from `/api/workflow/post_section_fields` for Writing stage outputs
- ✅ Added fallback method `initializeSingleFieldSelectorFallback()` for other cases
- ✅ Made methods async to handle API calls properly
- ✅ Endpoint returns: `["section_heading", "ideas_to_include", "facts_to_include", "highlighting", "image_concepts", "image_prompts", "watermarking", "image_meta_descriptions", "image_captions", "generated_image_url", "section_description", "status", "polished", "draft"]`

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ **Sections Loading Error**: Fixed `KeyError: 'uk_british'` in `/api/workflow/posts/<post_id>/sections` endpoint
- ✅ **Backend Field References**: Updated all SQL queries and JSON responses to use new field names (`draft`, `polished`) instead of old fields (`uk_british`, `generation`, `optimization`)
- ✅ **Individual Section Endpoint**: Fixed `/api/workflow/posts/<post_id>/sections/<section_id>` endpoint to use new field structure
- ✅ **PUT Method**: Updated section update logic to handle new field structure

**Documentation Updates:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation to `docs/reference/api/current/posts.md` with clear endpoint details
- ✅ Updated `docs/reference/workflow/llm_panel.md` with field selector system documentation
- ✅ Added clear note to `docs/README.md` about the correct endpoint URL
- ✅ Included testing examples and troubleshooting information
- ✅ Documented the important fact that the endpoint does NOT take a post_id parameter

**Testing Status:**
- ✅ Backend endpoint working: `curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/workflow/post_section_fields"` returns JSON with all text fields
- ✅ Sections endpoint working: `curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/workflow/posts/22/sections"` returns sections with new field structure
- ✅ Frontend page loads: `/workflow/posts/22/writing/content?step=author_first_drafts` shows sections panel
- ✅ Documentation is now crystal clear to prevent future confusion

**Files Updated:**
- `app/static/modules/llm_panel/js/field_selector.js` - Updated to use new endpoint for Writing stage outputs
- `app/api/workflow/routes.py` - Fixed all field references to use new field names
- `docs/reference/api/current/posts.md` - Added comprehensive endpoint documentation
- `docs/reference/workflow/llm_panel.md` - Added field selector system documentation
- `docs/README.md` - Added clear note about correct endpoint URL

**Key Documentation Points:**
- **Correct URL:** `/api/workflow/post_section_fields` (no post_id parameter)
- **Wrong URL:** `/api/workflow/post_section_text_fields/<post_id>` (doesn't exist)
- **Usage:** Writing stage LLM panel Outputs dropdown
- **Response:** Array of field names including `draft` and `polished`
