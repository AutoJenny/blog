# Phase 1 Sub-Plan: Planning and Implementation Guide

**Objective:**  
Create comprehensive documentation and analysis of the current system, design the new project structure, and assess risks/mitigation before any code or data is moved.

---

## 1.1 Detailed Analysis and Documentation

### Step 1: Database Schema Documentation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Export the current PostgreSQL schema (structure only, no data).
- [x] For each table, document:
  - Table purpose and which stage(s) use it.
  - All fields, types, constraints, and relationships.
  - Foreign key relationships and dependencies.
- [x] Save schema documentation as `/docs/temp/current_system_analysis.md`.
- [x] Identify and list which tables will be needed by each new project.

**Deliverable:** Complete database schema documentation with table assignments for each new project.

### Step 2: Code Inventory and Dependencies ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] List all Python files and their primary function (e.g., routes, models, utils).
- [x] For each file, note:
  - Which stage(s) it serves.
  - All import dependencies (internal and external).
  - Any shared utilities or functions.
- [x] Map all API endpoints to their handler files and document their purpose.
- [x] Save as `/docs/temp/dependency_maps/code_inventory.md` and `/docs/temp/dependency_maps/api_endpoints.md`.

**Deliverable:** Complete code inventory and API endpoints documentation with project assignments.

### Step 3: Configuration Analysis ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] List all environment variables currently in use.
- [x] Document all configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.py`).
- [x] For each, note:
  - What it configures.
  - Which projects/stages will need it.
- [x] Document database connection patterns and file system dependencies.
- [x] Save as `/docs/temp/current_system_analysis.md` (append to previous).

**Deliverable:** Complete configuration analysis with project-specific configuration requirements.

### Step 4: Testing Infrastructure ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] List all current test files and what they cover.
- [x] Identify critical functionality that must be preserved (list as test cases).
- [x] Create or update test scripts for each stage (manual or automated).
- [x] Document rollback procedures for each type of change.
- [x] Save as `/docs/temp/test_scripts/` and `/docs/temp/rollback_procedures.md`.

**Deliverable:** Complete testing infrastructure documentation and rollback procedures.

## 1.2 Project Structure Design

### Step 5: Core Project Design
- [ ] Define which utilities, database connectors, and config files will live in `blog-core`.
- [ ] Design the structure of `blog-core` (directory tree, module layout).
- [ ] Document how other projects will import from `blog-core`.

### Step 6: Stage Project Design
- [ ] For each stage (planning, writing, structuring, images, publishing):
  - Define its requirements and boundaries.
  - List the files/modules it will own.
  - Document its API boundaries and data access patterns.
  - Sketch its UI component isolation (if applicable).
- [ ] Save as `/docs/temp/project_architecture_design.md`.

### Step 7: Integration Design
- [ ] Define how projects will communicate (shared DB, API, file system).
- [ ] Document shared database access patterns.
- [ ] Draft deployment and monitoring strategies.
- [ ] Save as `/docs/temp/deployment_strategy.md`.

---

## 1.3 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Step 8: Technical Risks
- [ ] List all possible technical risks (DB conflicts, file system, ports, imports).
- [ ] For each, propose a mitigation strategy.
- [ ] Save as `/docs/temp/risk_assessment.md` and `/docs/temp/mitigation_strategies.md`.

### Step 9: Data Risks
- [ ] List all possible data risks (corruption, loss, inconsistency).
- [ ] For each, propose a backup and recovery procedure.
- [ ] Save as `/docs/temp/rollback_procedures.md`.

### Step 10: Development Risks
- [ ] List all possible development risks (cross-project contamination, testing, deployment, docs).
- [ ] For each, propose a mitigation strategy.
- [ ] Save as `/docs/temp/mitigation_strategies.md`.

---

## 1.4 Review and Approval

### Step 11: Review All Documentation
- [ ] Review all documentation for completeness and clarity.
- [ ] Ensure all deliverables are present and up to date.
- [ ] Confirm that a novice developer could follow the plan.

### Step 12: Approval Before Proceeding
- [ ] Do not proceed to Phase 2 until all documentation is reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Ensure backup and rollback procedures are tested and ready.

---

**Note:**  
Each step above should be checked off and deliverables verified before moving to the next phase. If any issues are found, update the documentation and mitigation strategies before proceeding.
