## 2025-11-02 - Newsletter Intro Components Enhanced with LLM & Intelligent Compilation

### Enhanced
- **Events Component**: Now uses LLM to generate conversational comments

  - LLM decides best order (which creates best opening, which should close)
  - Rewrites into single coherent paragraph (2-4 sentences)
  - Weaves information together naturally - doesn't just concatenate
  - Creates welcoming introduction that flows into newsletter content
  - Filters out placeholder/loading messages before processing

### Changed
