## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the complete transition from a monolithic `/blog` project to a multi-project architecture with strict isolation between workflow stages. The goal is to prevent cross-stage code contamination while maintaining full functionality and enabling reliable development of new stages.

### Target Architecture
```
/blog-core/          # Shared infrastructure, database, utilities
/blog-planning/      # Planning stage (purple module, post_development)
/blog-writing/       # Writing stage (green sections, post_section)
/blog-structuring/   # New "top and tail" stage (future)
/blog-images/        # Image generation and management
/blog-publishing/    # Publishing and syndication (future)
```

### Success Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved 100%
- No data loss or corruption
- Each project can run independently
- Clear boundaries prevent cross-contamination
- Rollback capability at every step

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive framework for reorganizing the blog project into separate, isolated projects. The key to success is careful planning, thorough testing, and the ability to rollback at any point.

**Critical Requirement:** Each phase must be fully planned and tested before implementation begins. Rushing any step risks breaking existing functionality and losing weeks of development time.

**Next Action:** Create detailed sub-plans for Phase 1 before proceeding with any implementation.
