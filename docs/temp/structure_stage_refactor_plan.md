# Structure Stage Refactor Plan (Updated 2024-06)

## 1. Schema Change: Add section_description to post_section

- Added `section_description TEXT` to the `post_section` table, immediately after `section_heading`.
- Updated all schema files (`create_tables.sql`, `backups/create_tables_pre_post_workflow_stage_fields.sql`) to include the new field.
- Performed full database backups before and after migration (`pg_dump`), and committed all changes to git.
- Confirmed that all backup/restore and schema management scripts are in sync with the new schema.
- See `/docs/database/sql_management.md` for the full protocol and rationale.

## 2. Canonical Mapping for Section Planning

- **section_heading** ← Section title (from LLM output `name`)
- **section_description** ← Section description (from LLM output `description`)
- **ideas_to_include** ← List of assigned ideas/themes (from LLM output `themes`, stored as JSON string)
- **facts_to_include** ← List of assigned facts (from LLM output `facts`, stored as JSON string)
- **section_order** ← Order in output array

## 3. LLM Output Structure

LLM should output:
```json
{
  "sections": [
    {
      "name": "Section Title",
      "description": "Short summary of the section",
      "themes": ["theme1", "theme2"],
      "facts": ["fact1", "fact2"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## 4. Frontend/JS
- Uses SortableJS for drag-and-drop of sections.
- Inline editing for section titles, descriptions, and ideas/facts.
- Explicit save with validation.
- "Unassigned" section for any unallocated items, not persisted if empty.
- On save, POSTs to backend, which updates `post_section` rows accordingly.

## 5. Backend
- Accepts structured JSON from frontend.
- Updates `post_section` rows for each section, including the new `section_description` field.
- Validates that all facts/ideas are assigned; unassigned items are handled in a special section in the UI but not persisted if empty.

## 6. Prompt Parts for Section Creator Action

- **System/Role:**
  > You are an expert editorial planner for long-form articles. Your job is to design a clear, engaging, and logically structured set of sections for a new article, based on the provided title, idea, and facts.
- **Style/Voice:**
  > Write for a general audience. Ensure the structure is accessible, engaging, and covers all provided themes and facts without overlap.
- **Instructions/Operation:**
  > You will be given:
  > - A provisional title for broad orientation.
  > - A basic idea describing the scope and themes to be explored.
  > - A set of interesting facts, each of which must be included in exactly one section.
  >
  > Your tasks:
  > 1. Devise and name a coherent, engaging section structure for the article. Each section should have a title and a short description.
  > 2. Allocate every theme, idea, and fact to exactly one section. No item should be left unassigned or assigned to more than one section.
  > 3. Output a JSON object with a "sections" array. Each section must include:
  >    - "name": Section title
  >    - "description": Short summary of the section
  >    - "themes": List of assigned themes/ideas (if any)
  >    - "facts": List of assigned facts (if any)
  > 4. If any theme, idea, or fact cannot be assigned, include it in an "unassigned" section at the end of the array.
  >
  > Be robust: handle any subject matter, and ensure the output is valid JSON.
- **Data Injection:**
  > Title: {{provisional_title}}
  > Basic Idea: {{basic_idea}}
  > Interesting Facts:
  > {{#each interesting_facts}}
  > - {{this}}
  > {{/each}}

## 7. Safety and Rollback
- All changes are fully backed up and versioned.
- If any issues arise, restore from the latest backup and revert the git commit.
- All schema, code, and documentation are now in sync.
- After restoring a backup, always check that all critical tables (including post_section) are present and contain data if expected. If a table is empty, confirm whether this is expected (e.g., new feature, not yet used) or a sign of a restore issue. Validate with curl or browser before proceeding.
- For the current project, post_section may be empty if the section workflow has not yet been used, and this is not an error in that case.

## 1. UI/UX Redesign
- [x] Design a custom template for the Structure stage (not the generic Template View)
- [x] Inputs Panel:
    - [x] Display all relevant input fields (title, idea, facts, etc.)
    - [x] Allow editing of these fields before running the LLM (UI only)
- [x] LLM Action Panel:
    - [x] Prominent "Plan Sections" button to trigger the LLM (UI only)
    - [x] Option to select which inputs to use (checkboxes or multi-select) (UI only)
- [x] Output Panel:
    - [x] Display LLM's proposed section structure as a list/table (placeholder UI only)
    - [x] Each row = one section (title, assigned ideas, assigned facts)
    - [ ] Enable drag-and-drop reordering of sections
    - [ ] Allow manual assignment of facts/ideas to sections (e.g., via dropdowns or drag-and-drop)
    - [ ] Allow editing of section titles and notes
- [x] Save/Accept Panel:
    - [x] "Accept Structure" button to save the proposed structure to the database (UI only)
    - [ ] Option to review/confirm before saving

---

## 2. Backend/Data Flow
- [ ] Review and document all relevant input fields in the DB (post, post_development, post_fact, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure facts/ideas are available in a structured format for assignment
- [ ] Implement endpoint to run LLM section planning:
    - [x] Accepts selected input fields
    - [x] Returns structured section plan (JSON: sections, assigned facts/ideas)
- [x] Implement endpoint to save structure:
    - [ ] Accepts edited section plan
    - [x] Persists to post_section and related tables
- [ ] Ensure robust error handling and validation

---

## 3. Drag-and-Drop & Manual Assignment
- [ ] Integrate a drag-and-drop library (e.g., SortableJS, Dragula, or native HTML5)
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for reordering sections
- [ ] Implement UI for manual assignment of facts/ideas to sections (drag-and-drop or dropdowns)
- [ ] Ensure assignments are reflected in the output data structure

---

## 4. Data Consistency & Stage Integration
- [ ] Review previous stages to ensure facts/ideas are structured and available
- [ ] If needed, refactor earlier stages to output structured data (not just text blobs)
- [ ] Ensure smooth transition from Structure to Authoring (post_section records created and ready)

---

## 5. Documentation & Review
- [ ] Document all UI/UX flows and 
backend endpoints
- [ ] Update wireframes and diagrams as needed
- [ ] Review plan with stakeholders before starting implementation

---

## 6. Implementation & Testing
- [ ] Implement frontend and backend changes as per plan
- [ ] Test all user flows (inputs, LLM, drag-and-drop, manual assignment, save)
- [ ] Validate data integrity and transitions to later stages
- [ ] Collect feedback and iterate
