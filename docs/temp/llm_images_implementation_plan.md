# LLM Image Generation Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan covers the implementation of a robust, production-ready system for generating images via multiple LLM providers (e.g., Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI, OpenAI DALL·E), supporting both testing/comparison and automated blog post workflows. It includes structured settings for SD, extensible provider support, and a UI for managing prompt examples and results.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Model Updates
- [x] Add structured fields to `ImageSetting` for SD/ComfyUI (width, height, steps, guidance_scale, extra_settings)
- [x] Update or create migration scripts to move from freeform to structured settings
- [x] Add `provider` field to prompt examples and/or image generation requests
- [x] Add `ImagePromptExample` model for prompt+style+format+provider combos

### 2. Backend API
- [x] CRUD API for `ImagePromptExample`
- [x] Update `/images/generate` endpoint for provider/structured settings
- [x] Add `/posts/<post_id>/generate_images` endpoint for batch section image generation

### 3. UI/UX
- [x] Provider dropdown and prompt example library in `/llm/images/prompts`
- [x] Multi-provider batch test/compare in `/llm/images/prompts`
- [x] Integrate batch image generation into blog post workflow UI (develop.html)

### 4. Production Integration
- [x] Automated image generation for new/updated posts
- [x] Admin review and override for generated images
- [x] Error handling, logging, and user feedback

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Data model changes complete
- [x] UI changes complete
- [x] Backend/API changes complete
- [x] Production workflow integration complete
- [x] Migration and data integrity verified
- [x] Documentation and testing complete

---

## Final System Summary
- Multi-provider (SD/ComfyUI, OpenAI DALL·E) image generation for blog posts
- Structured prompt/settings library, batch and per-section workflows
- Inline admin review, override, and error feedback
- Robust, extensible, and production-ready
