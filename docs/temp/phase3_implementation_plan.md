# Phase 3 Implementation Plan: Core, Planning, and Writing Transition

**Date:** 2025-07-18  
**Status:** PLANNING  
**Branch:** DEV77  
**Objective:** Migrate shared infrastructure to blog-core and workflow stages to blog-workflow with ZERO impact on original system

---

## Critical Requirements

### 1. Zero Impact Principle
- **Original blog system must remain 100% functional** throughout entire process
- **No modifications** to existing blog directory structure
- **No changes** to existing code, configuration, or dependencies
- **Migration only** - copy and adapt, don't modify original

### 2. One-Shot Execution
- **Single transition** from current state to new structure
- **Comprehensive testing** at each step using new testing protocol
- **Rollback capability** maintained at all times
- **No iterative changes** that could break original system

### 3. Risk Mitigation
- **Original system backup** verified before any changes
- **Isolated development** in separate project directories
- **Port conflict prevention** through careful planning
- **Dependency isolation** to prevent conflicts
