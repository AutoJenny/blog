2025-05-24: Began migration to direct SQL (psycopg2) for all LLM modular prompt features. Deprecated ORM models in app/models.py and removed SQLAlchemy imports from app/__init__.py. Marked app/llm/services.py, app/llm/routes.py, and app/api/llm.py for direct SQL refactor.

2025-05-23: Removed all remaining SQLAlchemy/ORM imports and usage from the codebase, including scripts, config, and API routes. Fully migrated to direct SQL (psycopg2) for all database access as part of the LLM modular prompt refactor. Cleaned up dependencies and configuration. [LLM Modular Prompt Refactor]

2025-05-24: Fixed critical /db route registration issue. Canonicalized db Blueprint definition by moving Blueprint creation and all route attachments to app/database/routes.py, and registering the Blueprint directly from there in the app factory. This robust pattern ensures all /db endpoints are always available and eliminates circular import issues. Verified with print_routes.py and curl. [Database Admin Robustness]

2025-05-24: Refactored /api/v1/llm/actions and /actions/<id> endpoints to use robust direct SQL (psycopg2) with parameterized queries and error handling. Registered llm_api Blueprint in the app factory to ensure all LLM API endpoints are available. Verified endpoint registration and correct JSON output with curl and print_routes.py. Updated modular prompt refactor plan. [LLM Modular Prompt Refactor]

2025-05-24: Refactored /api/v1/llm/actions/<id>/prompt_parts and linking endpoints to use robust direct SQL (psycopg2) with correct array handling for tags. Fully tested linking and unlinking prompt parts to actions. Updated modular prompt refactor plan. [LLM Modular Prompt Refactor]

2025-05-24: Refactored /api/v1/llm/actions/<id>/execute endpoint to use robust direct SQL (psycopg2), removed all ORM usage, and stubbed LLM call to return a dummy response for testing. Endpoint is now robust and testable without external dependencies. Updated modular prompt refactor plan. [LLM Modular Prompt Refactor]

2025-05-24: LLM Model/Provider Refactor & UI
- Refactored all LLM model and provider endpoints to use static Ollama-only data (no ORM, no DB dependency).
- Removed all SQLAlchemy/ORM usage from LLM provider/model endpoints.
- Fixed Edit Action modal on /llm/actions by making /api/v1/llm/providers and /api/v1/llm/models return static JSON.
- Added /llm/models UI page, linked in LLM nav, to display available models from API.
- Updated /llm/_llm_nav.html to include Models link and highlight active state.
- All endpoints and UI now robust, API-first, and ready for further modular prompt work.

2025-05-25: Completed removal of all SQLAlchemy/ORM usage and migrated all LLM modular prompt features to direct SQL (psycopg2). Updated all API endpoints and service logic. UI for Action Details and modular prompt part management is now being wired up and tested. Updated docs and migration plan. [LLM Modular Prompt Refactor]

2025-05-25: LLM Modular Prompt Part Migration & UI Complete

2025-05-25: /llm/prompts Prompt Parts tab is now default and includes a persistent radio filter for Type (All, system, user, assistant) above the list. Filtering is client-side and persists across tab switches.

2025-05-25: BUGFIX: Prompt Part 'Name' field is now correctly saved to the llm_prompt_part table via the API (POST/PUT). Previously, the name was not persisted due to missing SQL fields.

2025-05-26: BUGFIX: /db/backup now works by running pg_dump as the DB owner (nickfiddes), resolving permission errors and 500s in the UI. Backup Now button is functional again.

2025-05-26: RESTORED: Step-by-step Action creation wizard modal, with full instructions and navigation, is now back on /llm/actions. Users are guided through each stage of Action creation with contextual help and prompt part management.

- feat(nav): Added Workflow and Modules dropdowns to main header nav, plus a Docs link. Fixed Images link to /llm/images. All links tested via curl.
- fix(nav): Workflow and Modules dropdowns now open on hover, focus, or click, and close on outside click or Escape. Fully keyboard accessible and accessible for screen readers.
- fix(nav): Dropdowns now reliably activate on click, focus, and keyboard. JS toggles hidden/block classes for accessibility and compatibility.
- feat(llm): llm_prompt_part tags are now validated to only allow 'role', 'operation', 'format', 'specimen'. All existing rows set to ['role'].
- feat(llm): Prompt Parts tag filter selection is now persistent in localStorage and restored on page load for improved UX.
- feat(llm): Edit icon in Prompt Templates tab now switches to Assembler tab and loads the template for editing.
- feat(workflow): Workflow now persists active post selection across all stages using localStorage. Workflow nav links always include post_id. Post stays activated until another is selected.
- feat(workflow): Unified post header (title, created, updated) now appears above the heading on every workflow stage via shared macro. Editing the macro updates all stages.
- fix(workflow): All workflow stages now receive and render the post header. Backend passes post object to every stage template. Header is now visible on every workflow section.
- fix(workflow): Post header now always appears above workflow nav icons for consistent UX across all workflow stages.
- fix(workflow): Standardized post header spacing with consistent margin above and below via macro. Removed extra margin from workflow templates for uniform appearance across all stages.

2025-05-28: BUGFIX: Workflow LLM action run button now uses the correct /execute endpoint and passes the input field value as input_text and post_id. This fixes the 'No output.' bug on /workflow/idea and ensures [data:FIELDNAME] is correctly substituted in prompts. Verified with curl and browser. No backend changes required. [LLM Workflow Execution]

2025-05-28: BUGFIX: Fixed duplicate POST /api/v1/llm/actions handler in LLM API.
- Removed legacy handle_actions function, which conflicted with the new create_action handler.
- Removed debug return in create_action so the actual DB insert now runs.
- Added debug prints before and after the insert for robust troubleshooting.
- This resolves the persistent provider_id null bug and ensures correct Action creation via the API.

2025-05-29: BUGFIX: LLM Actions UI now recognizes both {status: 'success'} and {success: true} API responses for action creation.
- Fixed actionBuilderForm submit handler to check for both response formats.
- Users can now reliably create and update LLM actions from the UI regardless of backend response format.
- [LLM Actions Save UX]

2025-05-29: RESTORED: GET /api/v1/llm/actions endpoint now returns all LLM actions as JSON.
- Required for workflow and admin UIs to function correctly.
- Fixes 405 errors on workflow/idea and other pages that fetch the actions list.

- Added parse_tagged_prompt_to_messages utility to app/llm/services.py.
- Integrated into LLMService.execute_action for robust, provider-agnostic prompt/message handling.
- All LLM actions now use correct structure for chat and single-prompt LLMs.

2025-05-29: FEAT: prompt_text is now auto-generated from prompt_json on create/update in llm_prompt.
- Ensures all prompts and actions have canonical prompt_text for LLM execution.
- Follows the canonical mapping in docs/llm/llm_prompt_structuring.md.
- Fixes all issues with empty/null prompt_template in actions and robustifies LLM workflow.

2025-05-29: BUGFIX: prompt_json_to_text now robustly handles both modular array and canonical object formats.
- Prompt saving works for all UI formats (modular and canonical).
- Prevents 500 errors and ensures all prompts are usable by actions and LLMs.
- [LLM Prompt Robustness]

2025-05-29: REFACTOR: Modular prompt templates are now only transformed to canonical prompt/messages at action execution time.
- Added robust modular_prompt_to_canonical utility for runtime transformation.
- prompt_text is no longer generated or stored on save; only prompt_json (modular array) is stored.
- Ensures full reversibility and editability of prompt templates, and robust LLM execution for all providers.
- [LLM Prompt Runtime Transformation]

[2024-06-13] Fix: modular_prompt_to_canonical now produces a clean, natural prompt string for single-prompt LLMs (Ollama, etc.), joining all system/role/style/voice parts into a single instruction, all operation parts into a single instruction, and appending the input as a final line. Removed 'Task:' and 'Input:' prefixes for clarity and LLM compliance. Updated docs/llm/llm_prompt_structuring.md to match.

2025-05-30: FEAT: Workflow UI now displays a 'Start Ollama' button if a Run Action fails due to Ollama not running (connection refused).
- The button appears in the error panel and reuses the same logic as the providers page, posting to /api/v1/llm/providers/start and updating the UI accordingly.
- This improves user experience and makes it easy to recover from a stopped Ollama server directly from the workflow interface.

2024-06-09

- Milestone: Consolidated workflow idea templates into a modular, reusable structure for all workflow stages.
- Deprecated and archived duplicate idea/index.html templates.

- Debugged with direct API call to confirm row creation for research substage.
- Confirmed that modular panel and JS context now always send the correct substage.
- No database schema changes required.

2024-06-07 Refactor: Added modular LLM workflow panel to planning/structure substage
- Structure substage now uses the same modular include and JS as idea and research.
- Ensures all planning substages are fully consistent and DRY.

2024-06-07 Feat: Automatic workflow_field_mapping creation
- The backend now auto-creates workflow_field_mapping rows for new (field, substage) pairs on first use in the modular LLM panel.
- No manual DB update is needed when adding new substages or fieldsâ€”system is now fully plug-and-play.

2024-06-14 Feat: Universal modular LLM workflow panel and dropdown logic
- Modular LLM panel now used in all workflow substages (Planning, Authoring, Publishing).
- Dropdowns show all post_development fields but default to the current substage for robust cross-stage workflows.
- All documentation reviewed and updated to reflect the new universal modular framework and persistence logic.

- Remove Output Field from LLM Action creation/edit UI (/llm/actions)
- Make output_field optional in API: create_action and update_action endpoints now work without it
- prompt_text is now always auto-generated from prompt_json on prompt create/update, ensuring all prompts are compatible with LLM actions.
- Modular LLM workflow panel now always persists and restores selected input/output fields, even if not mapped to the current substage, by adding an 'Other: [field]' option for cross-stage persistence.

- /db/ UI now lists posts ordered by most recently updated first and supports pagination with Previous/Next buttons.

- Workflow panel now prevents running LLM actions with empty input fields (frontend), and backend error message now specifies which field is missing for clarity. 

[YYYY-MM-DD] Structure stage UI skeleton implemented: planning/structure/index.html now uses a custom template with Inputs, LLM Action, Output, and Accept panels (static UI only). Updated docs/temp/article_structure_and_preview_ui_implementation_checklist.md and docs/temp/structure_stage_refactor_plan.md.
