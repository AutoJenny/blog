## UI/UX Improvements (June 2024)
- The LLM Action Details page now uses the same four-step wizard-style layout as the action creation modal, but in a static/read-only form.
- Model Settings are displayed as disabled dropdowns for Provider, Model, and Prompt Template, with all options shown and the current value selected.
- All fields are read-only except the test area, which remains interactive.
- This ensures a consistent, user-friendly, and visually clear experience across the LLM Actions admin UI.
