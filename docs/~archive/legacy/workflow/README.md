# Legacy Workflow Documentation

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️

This directory contains legacy workflow documentation and references that are kept for historical purposes only. These files should **NOT** be used for active development.

## Purpose

These files are maintained as a reference for:
- Understanding the historical evolution of the workflow system
- Debugging issues that may be related to legacy data
- Reference for database migrations and schema changes

## Important Notes

1. The workflow system has been completely redesigned and these documents do not reflect the current implementation
2. Any code or database operations should use the new workflow system as documented in `/docs/workflow/`
3. These files are read-only and should not be modified
4. If you need to understand the current workflow system, please refer to the active documentation in `/docs/workflow/`

## Contents

- `stages.md`: Legacy stage and substage definitions
- `field_reference.md`: Legacy field mappings and data structures
- `database_schema.sql`: Legacy database schema definitions

## Migration Status

All legacy workflow functionality has been migrated to the new system. These files are maintained purely for reference purposes.
